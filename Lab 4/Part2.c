/*
Task: There are 10 students enrolled in a course. The course covers x number of chapters from a textbook (x > 1). 
In each chapter y number of homework(s) are assigned (y â‰¥ 1). The average grade for each homework in all the chapters needs to be found out.
To solve this, write a program that has the main process as Director process, which reads a file containing grades of all homework of all chapters and creates x number of Manager processes. 
Each Manager process will take care of solving a chapter. Each manager process will create y number of Worker process and pass one homework to each of them and they calculate and print the average.
The input file should contain the data according to the value of x and y. 
[See "quiz_grades.txt" in this repository for the input file used.]

The Director process is responsible for opening and closing the input text file.
It stores the values in a two dimensional integer array with 10 rows. You may need to use the following C functions (in addition to the necessary file & process management system calls): 
      fopen(), fscanf(), fseek(), fclose().
      
The process for creating workers is analogous. 
The Manager parent either gives the worker child the path of the file to open and an offset at which to read its values, or else passes the actual values to be averaged as a list of parameters.
